# Computer_Science_Project_Oct22
October 2022 computer science project repo

1. Theme: 

 

You have been tasked with creating an embedded system (artefact) that will meet a number of criteria. The computational artefact that you design should be personally relevant to you or your peers, to your community or to society in general. The actual theme and content of this project is up to you so long as it meets the criteria outlined below. 

 

In this Applied Learning Task (ALT 4), you will implement a microprocessor system (using the Micro:bit) that uses sensors and controls digital and analog inputs and outputs as part of an embedded system. 

 

By building the component parts of a computer system, you will demonstrate your understanding of how computers work and how they can be embedded in our everyday environments. 

 

 

2. Tasks: 

The Project: 

Create a project (the ‘device’) using a microprocessor and accessories such as BBC Micro:bit. 

Your device should read in data from at least one input device (minimum). 

Your project should output data through at least one output device (minimum). 

Your project should have a combination of digital and analog inputs and outputs. 

Evaluate, test and review your project 

 

Class Presentation (8 slide maximum) 

High level overview of your project 

Project demonstration 

3. Marking Criteria

 4. Final Report and Presentation: 

A presentation to the class will be required from each group showing off their project and what it can do. Ability to answer questions about your project from me and the other students is key here. 

 

5. Submission of Project: 

This project is due for submission on Thursday, 16th December 2021. The presentation of projects to the class will commence the following Monday (20th December). 

 

6. Documentation: 

 

You are required to produce planning documentation as well as a final report as detailed below. 

 

The Planning Document should contain the following elements: 

Project Title. 

Design Statement (1 paragraph). 

Target Audience (1 paragraph). 

Research in the area e.g. Internet, talking with other students, questionnaire, etc. 

Evaluation of ideas and proposed solutions 

Projected features of the chosen project i.e. what would you like to have? 

Team Members & Assigned Roles 

Flowchart Diagrams 

All rough work / sketching / brainstorming notes to be included 

 

The Project Report should contain the following elements: 

Overview of your project 

Details of its features and operation 

Photographic documentation of the final project 

Complete project code 

Outline of team member roles in production of project 

Reflection on planning versus implementation. 

What parts of the project worked out as expected? 

What parts of the project did not work out as expected? 

What were the biggest challenges of the project? 

Given more time to develop the project and your coding experience, what would you change or improve about your project? 

Any known issues/bugs in your final project?
