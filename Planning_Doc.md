# Rotating servo fan

The project will consist of a fan connected to two temperatur sensors. It will be able to dynamically choose where to cool depending on these inputs.
The two fan will be mounted on a 180 degree rotating servo. It will read the temperatures of the two sensors and decide which direction it should point towards.
The temperature sensors will consist of a microbit to read the temperature and send it to the fan, as well as an OLED screen to display the temperature.
These will be placed at different directions relative to the fan but should be at the same distance.
The fan will consist of a single microbit which will handle recieving inputs from the two temperature sensors. It will then control the 180 servo to point in a direction it will calculate based on the inputs recieved.
It will also handle turning the fan on and off.

The target audience of this project is anybody looking to save money and efficently cool an area. The Rotating Servo Fan will be able to cool an area that would usually require 2 fans, thus saving energy
and requiring less fans to be bought. It will be much less wasteful that traditional fans. The ideal use case of this is in offices with mutiple peopl working nearby. It will be able to keep 2 people cool by directing cold air at the person that most needs it.
