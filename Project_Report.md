# Project report

### Overview
Our project is a rotating fan that points in whichever direction is hotter. It does this to avoid wasting energy on cold areas and to do the job of 2 fans at once as efficently as possibly. It achieves this through 2 temperature sensors placed in the areas that need to be cooled. They record the temperature where they are and transmit this data to the fan which uses this information to decide where to point. This project is intended to save money on large scale operations by halfing the amount of fans needed for the customer. The idea use cases are schools or offices.

### Planning vs implementation

### Biggest challenges
- The fans did not work consistently
- Connecting the 180 servo to the fan was difficult to do effectively. There were problems with it falling off but the final solution works well.
